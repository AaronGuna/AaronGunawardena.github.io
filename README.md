# Anti-Monkey

Anti-monkey is a flutter flow project. The aim was to build mobile app  designed to provide crucial support and resources for individuals struggling with porn addiction. Offering a platform that will offer a safe and anonymous space for users to connect with a community of peers, access professional guidance, and equip themselves with practical tools for recovery. With a user-friendly interface and evidence-based content, Anti-monkey's goal was to empower individuals on their journey towards a healthier, more balanced life.
